This is where I'll be keeping track of my progress on my Natural Language Processing Semester project.  The current timeline is below:

Proposed Timeline Milestones:

* 2/21 - Gather all chapter summaries from ASOIAF wiki (will have to write python scraper for this) [**DONE**]

* 3/2 - Write reddit bot to scan subreddit and parse out relevant thread info for processing, i.e. thread original post text, response comments text, spoilers tags, etc.

* 3/14 - Research and choose approaches to extract and recognize spoilers (topic modeling/recognition, named-entity recognition, event extraction/recognition)

* 4/13 - Write main stage of program to identify spoilers

* 4/20 - Evaluate and refine as necessary
